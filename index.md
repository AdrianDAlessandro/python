This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.

This lesson assumes that you will be working from [Jupyter][jupyter].

> ## Why Python 3?
>
> Please note that this lesson uses [Python 3][python3] rather than [Python 2][python2]. Support for Python 2 is due to end in 2020, and users are strongly urged to move to Python 3 as soon as possible. Given this, it makes sense that new users should start with Python 3. As an added bonus, this allows us to make use of some new features of Python 3.
