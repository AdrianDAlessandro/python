## Variables

Any Python interpreter can be used as a calculator:
~~~
3 + 5 * 4
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
23
~~~
{: .output}

This is great but not very interesting.
To do anything useful with data, we need to assign its value to a _variable_.
In Python, we can [assign]({{ page.root }}/reference/#assign) a value to a
[variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#variable), using the equals sign `=`.
For example, to assign value `60` to a variable `weight_kg`, we would execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60
~~~
{: .language-python}

From now on, whenever we use `weight_kg`, Python will substitute the value we assigned to
it. In essence, **a variable is just a name for a value**.

In Python, variable names:

 - can include letters, digits, and underscores
 - cannot start with a digit
 - are [case sensitive]({{ page.root }}/reference/#case-sensitive).

This means that, for example:
 - `weight0` is a valid variable name, whereas `0weight` is not
 - `weight` and `Weight` are different variables

## Use variables to store values.

Remember high school algebra? Then you've seen variables before!

*   Variables are names for values.
*   In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
*   Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
    and a name in quotation marks to a variable `first_name`.

~~~
age = 42
first_name = 'Ahmed'
~~~
{: .python}

*   Variable names:
    *   cannot start with a digit
    *   cannot contain spaces, quotation marks, or other punctuation
    *   *may* contain an underscore (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
*   Underscores at the start like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.
    
> ## Variables as Sticky Notes

> This means that assigning a value to one variable does **not** change
> values of other variables.
> For example, let's store the subject's weight in pounds in its own variable:
>
> ~~~
> # There are 2.2 pounds per kilogram
> weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
> print(weight_kg_text, weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> weight in kilograms: 65.0 and in pounds: 143.0
> ~~~
> {: .output}

>
> Let's now change `weight_kg`:
>
> ~~~
> weight_kg = 100.0
> print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg, 'and weight in pounds is still:', weight_lb)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> weight in kilograms is now: 100.0 and weight in pounds is still: 143.0
> ~~~
> {: .output}

> Since `weight_lb` doesn't "remember" where its value comes from,
> it is not updated when we change `weight_kg`.
{: .callout}


## Use `print` to display values.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   The values passed to the function are called 'arguments'

~~~
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.

## Variables persist between cells.

*   Variables defined in one cell exist in all other cells once executed, 
    so the relative location of cells in the notebook do not matter (i.e., cells
    lower down can still affect those above).
*   Notebook cells are just a way to organize a program;
    as far as Python is concerned,
    all of the source code is one long set of instructions.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error.
    *   Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.

~~~
print(last_name)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(last_name)

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ site.github.url }}/05-error-messages/).

## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names
    so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
~~~
{: .python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned 42 to `age` a few lines ago.

~~~
age = age + 3
print('Age in three years:', age)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Age in three years: 45
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Swapping Values
>
> Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program
> after each statement is executed.
> In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?
>
> ~~~
> lowest = 1.0
> highest = 3.0
> temp = lowest
> lowest = highest
> highest = temp
> ~~~
> {: .source}
{: .challenge}

> ## Predicting Values
>
> What is the final value of `position` in the program below?
> (Try to predict the value without running the program,
> then check your prediction.)
>
> ~~~
> initial = "left"
> position = initial
> initial = "right"
> ~~~
> {: .source}
{: .challenge}




## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
first = 1
second = 5 * first
first = 2
print('first is', first, 'and second is', second)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
first is 2 and second is 5
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `second`.
*   After that, `second` does not remember where it came from.
