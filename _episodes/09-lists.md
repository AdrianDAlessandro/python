questions:
- "How can I store multiple values?"
objectives:
- "Explain why programs need collections of values."
- "Write programs that create flat lists, index them, slice them, and modify them through assignment and method calls."
keypoints:
- "A list stores many values in a single structure."
- "Use an item's index to fetch it from a list."
- "Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them."
- "Appending items to a list lengthens it."
- "Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely."
- "The empty list contains no values."
- "Lists may contain values of different types."
- "Character strings can be indexed like lists."
- "Character strings are immutable."
- "Python uses 0-based indexing. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth"
- "Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error."

## Collections

We have already encountered some simple Python types like integers, strings and booleans. Now we will see how we can group multiple values together in a collection â€“ like a list of numbers or a list of names. Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, and include lists, dictionaries and tuples, which will cover in future lessons. 

### Lists

*   A list stores many values in a single structure.
*   Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `weight_001`, `weight_002`, etc.,
    would be at least as slow as doing them by hand.
*   Use a *list* to store many values together.
    *   Contained within square brackets `[...]`.
    *   Values separated by commas `,`.
*   Use `len` to find out how many values are in a list.
