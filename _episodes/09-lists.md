## Lists are collections of data 

We have already encountered some simple Python types like integers, strings and booleans. Now we will see how we can group multiple values together in a collection â€“ like a list of numbers or a list of names. Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, and include lists, dictionaries and tuples, which we will cover in future lessons. 

*   A list stores many values in a single structure.
*   Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `weight_001`, `weight_002`, etc.,
    would be at least as slow as doing them by hand.
*   Use a *list* to store many values together.
    *   Contained within square brackets `[...]`.
    *   Values separated by commas `,`.
*   Use `len` to find out how many values are in a list.

~~~
weights = [173, 175, 277, 275, 176]
print('weights:', weights)
print('length:', len(weights))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
weights: [173, 175, 277, 275, 176]
length: 5
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an item's index to fetch it from a list.

*   To get the first element of this list we use the index 0 because python is a 0-based indexing lamnguage. 
*   Indexes are written within square brackets `[]`.

~~~
print('zeroth item of weights:', weights[0])
print('fourth item of weights:', weights[4])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth item of weights: 173
fourth item of weights: 176
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them.

*   Use an index expression on the left of assignment to replace a value.

~~~
weights[0] = 265
print('weights is now:', weights)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
weights are now: [0.265, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
~~~
{: .output}

## Appending items to a list lengthens it.

*   Use `list_name.append` to add items to the end of a list.

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5]
print('primes is initially:', primes)
primes.append(7)
primes.append(9)
print('primes has become:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes is initially: [2, 3, 5]
primes has become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
~~~
{: .output}

*   `append` is a *method* of lists.
    *   Like a function, but tied to a particular object.
*   Use `object_name.method_name` to call methods.
    *   Deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.
*   We will meet other methods of lists as we go along.
    *   Use `help(list)` for a preview.
*   `extend` is similar to `append`, but it allows you to combine two lists.  For example:

~~~
teen_primes = [11, 13, 17, 19]
middle_aged_primes = [37, 41, 43, 47]
print('primes is currently:', primes)
primes.extend(teen_primes)
print('primes has now become:', primes)
primes.append(middle_aged_primes)
print('primes has finally become:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes is currently: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes has now become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19]
primes has finally become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, [37, 41, 43, 47]]
~~~
{: .output}

Note that while `extend` maintains the "flat" structure of the list, appending a list to a list makes the result two-dimensional.

## Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely.

*   `del list_name[index]` removes an item from a list and shortens the list.
*   Not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

~~~
print('primes before removing last item:', primes)
del primes[4]
print('primes after removing last item:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes before removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes after removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

## The empty list contains no values

*   Use `[]` on its own to represent a list that doesn't contain any values.
    *   "The zero of lists."
*   Helpful as a starting point for collecting values
    (which we will see in future chapters).

## Lists may contain values of different types

*   A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.

~~~
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .python}

## Remember that character strings can be indexed like lists

*   Get single characters from a character string using indexes in square brackets.

~~~
element = 'carbon'
print('zeroth character:', element[0])
print('third character:', element[3])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth character: c
third character: b
~~~
{: .output}

## But unlike lists, character strings are immutable

*   Cannot change the characters in a string after it has been created.
    *   *Immutable*: can't be changed after creation.
    *   In contrast, lists are *mutable*: they can be modified in place.
*   Python considers the string to be a single value with parts,
    not a collection of values.

~~~
element[0] = 'C'
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .error}

*   Lists and character strings are both *collections*.

## Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error

*   Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist.
    *   This is a kind of runtime error.
    *   Cannot be detected as the code is parsed
        because the index might be calculated based on data.

~~~
print('99th element of element is:', element[99])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
IndexError: string index out of range
~~~
{: .output}

## Slicing python lists

Let's start with a normal, everyday list. Nothing crazy, just a normal list with the numbers 1 through 8. Now let's say that we really want the elements 2, 3, and 4 returned in a new list. How do we do that?

~~~
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
mylist[1:4] 
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[2, 3, 4]
~~~
{: .output}

*   Remeber that `1` is the second element of this list because of the 0-based indexing

## Slice indices have useful defaults

*   An omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
*   An omitted first index defaults to zero.

~~~
mylist[4:] # list elements from position 4 (included) to the end. Start counting from 0!
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[5, 6, 7, 8]
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
mylist[:5] # list elements from the beginning to position 5 (excluded)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
~~~
{: .output}

*   Lists can also be sliced in reverse order. 

~~~
print(mylist[-1])    # last item in the array
print(mylist[-2:])   # last two items in the array
print(mylist[:-2])   # everything except the last two items
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
8
[7, 8]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
~~~
{: .output}

One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing *between* characters, with the left edge of the  first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:

~~~
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
-8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
