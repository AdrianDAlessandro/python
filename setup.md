## Install Python 3

In this course we will be using Python 3 with some of its scientific libraries running in a Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, a laptop running Jupyter Notebook is a requirement. We recommend installing Anaconda, a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the course. To do this go to the CSIRO software centre and search ‘Anaconda’.

1. Click on Ananconda Python3
2. Click the install button (this will take some time)

Alternatively, if you have administration rights on your computer you can download Anaconda from:
