title: Setup
---
In this course we will be using Python 3 with some of its scientific libraries running in a Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, a laptop running Jupyter Notebook is a requirement. We recommend installing Anaconda, a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the course. To do this go to the CSIRO software centre and search ‘Anaconda’.

- Click on Ananconda Python3
- Click the install button (this will take some time)

Alternatively, if you have administration rights on your computer you can download Anaconda from:
